# Netflix and Code

Netflix and Code allow you to search over 3500 Netflix categories. You can see all the alphabetically listed and you can also filter by the search box.

Requested challange was to build a simple webpage that shows the hidden categories on Netflix, give users the ability to search for a genre or category and then see the results. Without using any third-party library, with using plain es6 I have created a base component class to render basic DOM element. I prepared other related elements to build a simple table view using this base class just to demonstrate es6 skills, functional & component based approaches.
